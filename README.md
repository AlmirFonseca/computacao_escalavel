1. the first and recommended alternative is to access the code directly from our [URL](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OBAGfokRVal67toYM3z2o5B1-z4XjC1o?usp=sharing), and create your own copy and click on run all (it might take some minutes)
2. as a second option, you can run all the jupyter notebook locally - but you have to have internet connection so the code can automatically download shakespeare.txt the text available on [this URL](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt)
   1. If you choose this option, use Visual Studio Code to run all, making sure you have choose python 3.11 as kernel.
